<h1 align="left">CSE P 501 Au11 - MiniJava</h1>
<h2 align="left">Overview</h2>
<p align="left">The course project is to implement the MiniJava language
  specified in the Appendix of Appel's <em>Modern Compiler Implementation in
  Java, </em>2nd edition and described on the <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/resources/052182060X/">MiniJava
  web site</a>. MiniJava is
  a subset of Java and the meaning of a MiniJava program is given by its meaning
  as a
  Java
  program.</p>
<p align="left">Compared to full Java, a MiniJava program consists of a single
  class containing a static main method followed by zero or more other classes.
  There are no other static methods or variables. Classes may extend other classes,
  and method overriding is included, but method overloading is not.
  All classes making up a MiniJava program are included in a single source file.
   The only types available are <code>int</code>, <code>boolean</code>,  <code>int[]</code> and reference types (classes). "<code>System.out.println(...);</code>"
   is a statement and can only print integers - it is not a normal method call,
   and does not refer to a static method of a class. All methods are value-returning
   and must end with a single <code>return</code> statement. The only other available
   statements are <code>if</code>, <code>while</code>, and assignment. There are other simplifications to keep the project size reasonable.</p>
<p align="left">The <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/resources/052182060X/MCIIJ2e/grammar.htm">full
MiniJava grammar</a> is given on the project web site and in the Appendix of
Appel's <em>Modern Compiler Implementation in Java</em> (2nd ed). Look 
at the
grammar carefully to see what is and is not included in the language 
subset. You should implement  full MiniJava as described there, except 
that you do  not need to implement nested <code>/*</code> comments <code>*/</code>. (You need to implement <code>/* */</code> comments,  but do not need to allow them to nest, i.e., the first <code>*/</code> terminates any  open  comment regardless of how many <code>/*</code> symbols have appeared before it, as in standard  Java. You also need to implement <code>//</code> comments.)</p>
<p align="left">There are two symbols in the grammar that are not   
otherwise specified. An &lt;IDENTIFIER&gt; is a sequence of letters,   
digits, and underscores, starting with a letter. Uppercase letters are  
 distinguished from lowercase. An &lt;INTEGER_LITERAL&gt; is a sequence 
  of decimal digits that denotes an integer value.</p>
<h2>Extensions</h2>
<p>The basic project requirements are small enough to be tractable in a one-quarter
  course project, but include enough to cover the core ideas of compiling an
  object-oriented
(as well as procedural) language. If you are feeling ambitous and have the time,
  you are invited to add additional parts of Java to the language. Here are a
  few suggestions.</p>
<p><em>Some Simple Ideas</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Add /* ... */ comments  that might or might not span
    multiple lines, with or without nesting.</li>
  <li>Add additional binary arithmetic and relational operators for integers.</li>
  <li>Add <code>null</code> as a constant expression and support <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code> for object reference
    types.</li>
  <li>Allow <code>return</code> statements anywhere in a method.</li>
  <li>Allow calls of local methods without the explicit use of <code>this</code>.</li>
  <li>Relax the ordering of declarations so that variables can be declared anywhere
    in a method body.</li>
  <li>Allow initialization of variables in declarations.</li>
  <li>Add <code>void</code> methods, a <code>return</code> statement with no
    expression, and appropriate type checking rules.</li>
  <li>Support <code>public</code> and <code>private</code> declarations on both
  methods and instance variables, and check to ensure that access restrictions
    are not violated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding an additional numeric type like <code>double</code> would not be particularly
  interesting, since there is relatively little difference in how the compiler
  handles <code>ints</code> and
  <code>doubles</code>. However, adding <code>String</code> literals and the
  concatenation (+) operator would be interesting.</p>
<p><em>More Sophisticated, but very interesting</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Support <code>instanceof</code> and type casts (which can require a runtime <code>instanceof</code>    check).</li>
  <li>Support <code>super.</code> as a prefix in ordinary method calls.</li>
  <li>Add constructor declarations with optional parameters. To make this useful,
      you probably want to include the use of <code>super(...)</code> at the
      beginning of the body of a constructor.</li>
  <li>Support arrays of objects (no harder to implement than arrays of ints,
  except the type checking rules are more interesting).</li>
</ul>
<p>Of the suggested extensions, adding <code>instanceof</code>, type casts, and <code>super.</code> are
  particularly instructive.</p>
<p>Some extra credit will be awarded to projects that go beyond the basic
  requirements.</p>
<h2>Implementation Languages</h2>
<p>The project description and information are written assuming you are 
implementing the project in Java. Other implementation languages are 
allowed provided they are reasonable; please check with the instructor 
first if you wish to try something different. If you do use a different 
language you should use lex/yacc - equivalent tools to generate the 
parser and scanner, and you will need to make the appropriate 
adjustments in instructions in places where they describe specific 
implementation details.</p>
